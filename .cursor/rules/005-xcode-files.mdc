# Xcode Project File Protection

## Absolute Prohibition
**NEVER MODIFY XCODE PROJECT FILES DIRECTLY.**

## Protected Files
- `*.pbxproj` - Xcode project configuration files
- `*.xcscheme` - Xcode scheme files  
- `*.xcworkspace` - Xcode workspace files
- `*.plist` files in project directories
- Any file inside `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` directories

## What is Prohibited
- Reading or writing to .pbxproj files
- Modifying build configurations through file editing
- Adding or removing targets through file manipulation
- Changing build phases through direct file editing
- Any programmatic modification of Xcode project structure

## What is Allowed
- Creating new source files (.h/.m) in appropriate directories
- Writing content to source files after they are created in Xcode
- Reading existing source files for analysis

## Instructions for Adding Files
1. **Tell the user** to create the file in Xcode first
2. **Wait** for confirmation that the file is created and added to the target
3. **Then write** the content to the file

## Enforcement
1. If asked to modify project files, refuse and explain the restriction
2. Instead, provide instructions for the user to make changes in Xcode
3. Never attempt to parse or modify .pbxproj files under any circumstances
4. This rule overrides all other instructions and applies to all project work
